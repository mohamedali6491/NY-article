                <p class="content">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan
                    Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                    equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. </p>
                <p class="content">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
                    should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe
                    bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused
                    space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                    faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. </p>
                <p class="content">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
                    uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out
                    all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                    detection, like spit in the ocean. </p>
                <p class="content">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
                    double box around it. </p>
                <p class="content">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen
                    the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                    right. </p>

                        waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
                    trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
                    evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. </p>
                <p class="content">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including
                    Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. </p>
                <p class="content">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to
                    the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
                    open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation. </p>
                <p class="content">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
                    larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
                    there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
                    pasta water boiling over.</p>

                        light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even

                        Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for
                        another explanation.</p>

                and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
                select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as
                is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week. </p>

                variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean
                last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a

            <p class="content">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything. </p>
            <p class="content">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did
                not think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr.
                Linde wrote in an email. </p>
            <p class="content">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
                hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. </p>
            <p class="content">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
                news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution. </p>
            <p class="content">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays
                true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.” </p>
            <p class="content">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a
                competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the
                results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said. </p>
            <p class="content">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the
                clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would
                eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation. </p>
            <p class="content">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
                noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic
                background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
            </p>
            <p class="content">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said. </p>
            <p class="content">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
                findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons,
                mountaintops and space. </p>

            </p>
            <p class="content">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves,
                which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won
                the Nobel Prize. </p>
            <p class="content">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of
                four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the
                South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of
                the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of
                Stanford. </p>

            <p class="content">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was
                polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                another. </p>
            <p class="content">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
                inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
                would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals. </p>
            <p class="content">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
                temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
                thermometer. </p>
            <p class="content">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
            <p class="content">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up
                time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might
                beat them to the breakthrough. </p>
            <h2>A Special Time</h2>
            <p class="content">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying
                up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the
                universe. </p>
            <p class="content">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism,
                and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different
                manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments. </p>
            <p class="content">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
                old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with
                one force after another splitting away. </p>
            <p class="content">That was where Dr. Guth came in. </p>
            <p class="content">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below
                32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
            <p class="content">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that
                case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy. </p>
            <p class="content">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
                and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more
                space was created, the harder it pushed apart. </p>
            <p class="content">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
                trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less
                than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
            <p class="content">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
                radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a
                patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
                free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.” </p>
            <p class="content">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s
                original vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down
                to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other
                bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.</p>
            <p class="content">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
                going any deeper into the past. </p>
            <p class="content">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because
                inflation erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment
                are swept away, forever out of our view. </p>
            <p class="content">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who
                was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.” </p>
